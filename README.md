# Julia: VGG16 and ResNet18

## Motivation
The bottleneck of deep learning, which involves large-scale architectures, is training time. Python is a popular language for deep learning. However, it is slow when it handles large volumes of data. Julia is Python-like but is faster than Python because Julia uses Just-In-Time compilation. Simply, Julia combines C and Python. Having said that, there are fewer resources available, and it is difficult to implement a model in Julia. This project shows how to implement VGG16 and ResNet18 from scratch with Cifer10.
